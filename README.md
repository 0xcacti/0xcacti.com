## 0xcacti's Personal Website 

This website was previously written in React, but 
I disliked it so much that I never really wanted to 
actually do anything.  Thus, it languished as a 
simple singe page website with no functionality.

Recently, I started learning lisp.  I really just wanted to 
do it for fun.  Still, I couldn't think up any fun projects to build in 
lisp. I just didn't know what I could even use lisp for. As I got better, 
however, I realized I can do whatever I want in lisp and it will be awesome. 
Then, I remembered that my website sux. 
So I decided to re-write it using Common Lisp using HTMX, and boom, this weird project was born.
