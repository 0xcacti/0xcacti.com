## 0xcacti's Personal Website 

This website was previously written in React, but 
I disliked it so much that I never really wanted to 
actually do anything.  Thus, it languished as a 
simple singe page website with basically no functionality.

Recently, I started learning lisp.  I really just wanted to 
do it for fun.  Still, I couldn't think up any fun projects to build in 
lisp.  In my mind, it just wasn't the right language for the 
things I wanted to build.  Then I remembered that my website stinks. 
So I decided to re-write it using Common Lisp and HTMX, that way it 
would be sufficiently weird and fun and I could build a real project in 
lisp!
