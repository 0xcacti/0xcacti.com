## 0xcacti's Personal Website

Created a personal website because I guess I should have one.

### Ascii Art

```
        |\ _ /|
       ( o  o )
        > . </
        |    \
        |  |  \
        |  |   |
       (_(_f_, ) 0xcacti
             //
            ((
            ))
            ((
             v
```

I created the cat on my homepage all by myself. I decided to name him "Glumly".
If you are an ascii artist that can make cool cats, I will pay you in ETH for the art.
I like Glumly, but he is a little goofy.

### Warning

I wrote the website in svelte. I have no idea what I am doing.
I am a much better smart contract developer, but all contracts may have bugs that I missed.  
USE ALL APPS ON MY WEBSITE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
